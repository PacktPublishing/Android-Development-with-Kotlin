# Android Development with Kotlin
This is the code repository for [Android Development with Kotlin](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/android-development-kotlin?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787123687), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
The book is divided in three modules that show the power of Kotlin and teach you how to use it properly. Each module present features in different levels of advancement. The first module covers Kotlin basics. This module will lay a firm foundation for the rest of the chapters so you are able to read and understand most of the Kotlin code. The next module dives deeper into the building blocks of Kotlin, such as functions, classes, and function types. You will learn how Kotlin brings many improvements to the table by improving common Java concepts and decreasing code verbosity. The last module presents features that are not present in Java. You will learn how certain tasks can be achieved in simpler ways thanks to Kotlin.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.
* The source code for the Android application developed in chapter 9 is provided in the folder of chapter 9. 
* The color images of the screenshots present in chapter 9 is provided in the folder of the chapter.

The code will look like the following:
```
val capitol = "England" to "London"
println(capitol.first) // Prints: England
println(capitol.second) // Prints: London
```

To test and use the code presented in this book, you need only Android Studio installed. Chapter 1, Beginning your Kotlin Adventure, explains how a new project can be started and how the examples presented here can be checked. It also describes how most of the code presented here can be tested without any program installed.
